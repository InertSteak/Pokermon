Pokermon is a full content mod for Balatro, adding content based on Pokémon. There are now 439+ Jokers that have been added alongside many other custom additions.
There is also an option to only play with Pokemon Jokers if you want to focus on the new content. (Option defaults to on)

**Prerequisites:**

Both [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) (use latest release if you can, some things may be broken on earlier versions) and [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) (use latest release) must be installed.

**Installation:**

1. Download the zip file with the contents of the repository. (Code -> Download Zip)\
2. Create a folder named Pokermon inside your mods folder.
3. Extract the zip file into the mods folder. Make sure that there is a single folder between the mods folder and the contents. (Ie it should go Mods\Pokermon\contents and not Mods\Pokermon\Pokermon\contents or Mods\contents, where contents are the inner files)
4. Make sure the files are directly under the Pokermon folder in your mods folder and not under the zip file folder.
   (In other words, unzip the file and then copy and paste the assests, config.lua, pokermon.lua, etc to be under the Pokermon folder in the mods folder) 

**Roadmap:**
- Implementation of every Gen III Pokémon, as well as features and mechanics based on the generation
- More Boss Blinds based on evil teams
- Field/Route mechanic for the shop to help you find specific Pokémon jokers
- Weather-based mechanics
- A new edition?
- More custom art by our amazing artists!

**Card Images:**

Guests artists are welcome! Want your art in the game? Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/AptX86Qsyz)! We have a section where you can submit your custom sprites, check up our guidelines, seek tutorials on Balatro art, and even pixel art too! We have templates and palettes available as resources, and a talented and caring community!
Not only will your art be credited in-game, we have a section in our credits reserved for our guest artists! There, players can not only view an artist's sprites they've made to the mod gallery-style, but also view and visit any links to social media profiles or websites you'd like to share!

Our current goal is to have custom sprites for every Pokémon in the National Dex!
