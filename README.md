# Pokermon
Huge thank you to [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector), [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded), [Cryptid](https://github.com/MathIsFun0/Cryptid) and [Betmma](https://github.com/betmma/my_balatro_mods)!
This mod and its features would not be possible otherwise. Additonaly thank you to everyone who helps with the project, please check out the credits tab on the mod menu!

We now have a discord server [here](https://discord.gg/3GZTGppef4)! Please report any to bugs or issues me so I can hopefully fix them and feel free to make suggestions or contribute to the mod.
Please use the latest code before repoting issues, the releases may be out of date with the current code.

Pokermon is a full content mod for Balatro, adding content based on Pokemon. There are now 200(!!) Jokers that have been added alongside many other custom additions.
There is also an option to only play with Pokemon Jokers if you want to focus on the new content. (Option defaults to off)

**Prerequisites:**

**IMPORTANT**: You must download the latest version of steamodded and NOT use the release version which is very old. The mod will run into errors otherwise.

The upper right of the title screen has the steamodded version. This is the current minimum version for the latest release:

Both [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) (use v0.6.0 if you can, some things may be broken on v0.5.0 beta 6) and [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) (use latest) must be installed.

**Installation:**

1. Download the zip file with the contents of the repository. (Code -> Download Zip)\
2. Create a folder named Pokermon inside your mods folder.
3. Extract the zip file into the mods folder. Make sure that there is a single folder between the mods folder and the contents. (Ie it should go Mods\Pokermon\contents and not Mods\Pokermon\Pokermon\contents or Mods\contents, where contents are the inner files)
4. Make sure the files are directly under the Pokermon folder in your mods folder and not under the zip file folder.
   (In other words, unzip the file and then copy and paste the assests, config.lua, pokermon.lua, etc to be under the Pokermon folder in the mods folder) 

**Roadmap:**

~~In the immediate future, I would like to polish and fine tune the Gen I Pokemon along with bug fixing.~~ 
~~Implement pokemon related to existing pokemon~~

**Card Images:**

If you'd like to contribute any card designs I would really appreciate it. Of course I'd be sure to credit you here in this readme file and via tooltip on the Joker itself. Be sure to check in the discord before you work on art assets, we've got templates for the Pokemon Jokers.
